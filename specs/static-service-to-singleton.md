## Overview

This is an OpenRewrite recipe project that converts static services into standard Java singleton services.

### Example

```java
class Service {

    static {
        System.out.println("Hello from Service initializer");
    }

    public static Result action(Input input) { ... }
}

class ServiceConsumer {
    public void doThing() {
        Service.action(new Input());
    }
}
```

will be converted into:

```java
class Service {

    private static final Service INSTANCE = new Service();

    public static Service instance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    public Service() {
        System.out.println("Hello from Service initializer");
    }

    public Result action(Input input) { ... }

}

class ServiceConsumer {

    private final Service service;

    public ServiceConsumer() {
        this(Service.instance());
    }

    public ServiceConsumer(Service service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public void doThing() {
        service.action(new Input());
    }
}
```

### Changes Made to the Service Class

1.  The `static` modifier is removed from all public static methods.
2.  A new `private static final Service INSTANCE` field is added if it does not already exist, initialized with a new class instance.
3.  A new `public static Service instance()` method is added to return the singleton `INSTANCE`.
4. Static initializer in the Service class is converted to default constructor

### Changes Made to ServiceConsumer Classes

1.  A new `private final` field is added to hold a reference to the service.
2.  If class does not contain any service invocations from non-static context, do not change the class.
3.  Existing constructors are modified to accept an instance of the service as a parameter
    and a delegate constructor with original signature is added that delegates construction to new constructor and getting the service using `Service.instance()`.
4.  If no constructors exist, a new one is created that accepts the service and a default constructor is added that initializes the service using `Service.instance()`.
5.  Static method calls are updated to use the new service field, if invocation is from non-static method. If calling site is static method, then invocation should not be changed. Also calls from lambda expressions should follow previous rule.


### With extractServiceInterface Parameter

When `extractServiceInterface=true`, the refactoring also creates an interface:

```java
interface IService {
    Result action(Input input);
}

class Service implements IService {
    private static final Service INSTANCE = new Service();

    public static IService instance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    public Result action(Input input) { ... }
}

class ServiceConsumer {
    private final IService service;

    public ServiceConsumer(IService service) {
        this.service = service;
    }

    public ServiceConsumer() {
        this(Service.instance());
    }

    public void doThing() {
        service.action(new Input());
    }
}
```

Note: The interface type is used instead of the concrete Service type in consumer classes and the `instance()` method return type.

## Recipe Parameters

| Parameter                        | Description                                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| serviceClassName                 | The fully qualified name of the service class to refactor.                                                          |
| annotateMethods                  | The fully qualified name of the annotation to be added to new methods. If not defined, no annotation is added.      |
| annotateConstructors             | The fully qualified name of the annotation to be added to new constructors. If not defined, no annotation is added. |
| addDefaultConstructorToConsumers | Whether a default constructor should be added to consumer classes.                                                  |
| changeStaticCallsThroughInstance | If set to `true`, changes static invocations with the instance indirection `Service.doThing()` becomes `Service.instance().doThing()`.                                  |
| extractServiceInterface          | When set to `true`, creates an interface (IService) with all public methods from the Service class. The Service class will implement this interface, and the `instance()` method will return the interface type. **Note:** The interface is currently added to the same file as the Service class (not a separate file). |
| minimizeChanges                  | When set to `true`, skips the auto-formatting pass so that only structural AST changes are applied. Useful for reducing whitespace-only diffs. |
| targetVisibilities               | Selects which static methods on the Service to modify based on their current visibility. Only methods matching the chosen scope(s) will be updated. Values: `ALL`, `PUBLIC`, `PROTECTED`, `PRIVATE` or `PACKAGE´. Note: Regardless of this setting, the extracted interface is defined only from `PUBLIC` methods. Default: `PUBLIC´ |
| updateFields                     | When set to `true`, remove static modifier from non-public fields are accessed by methods whose static modifier is removed. Unless field is final and type is known to be immutable (primitive, String, enum etc.). Or name is written in all capital letters (then we'll assume it to be a constant). |
| updateWrittenFields              | When set to `true`, remove static modifier from public fields, that are written by methods whose static modifier is removed. |
| updateAccessedFields             | When set to `true`, remove static modifier from public fields, that are accessed by methods whose static modifier is removed. Unless field is final and type is known to be immutable (primitive, String, enum etc.). Or name is written in all capital letters (then we'll assume it to be a constant). |
